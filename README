Small utility to display bits dump of number.

Overview
----------

This utility was created for the purpose to provide bits dump of value and
calculate value of given bits range. This is very often required for
hardware programming. e.g. we get some register value and need to use
bits range [4-18] to calculate some specific hardware parameter. The goal
of this utility is to simplify given task.

Usage
----------
Usage is straightforward. Run utility and enter value using prompt. 
The following commands are supported:
        h               - Display short help;
        q               - Quit
        Rx,y            - Display value for bits in given range. Note,
                          then x should be less or equal than y. Spaces are
                          not allowed. This operation uses the current number
                          to calculate range value.
        x                - New number. You have to input number based on "C"
                           standard.  e.g. 0x10 - hex. number
                                           10   - dec. number
                                           AA   - invalid number.
